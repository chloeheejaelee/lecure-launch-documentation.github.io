## What is Angular?

Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework. Angular is popular because it is a component of the MEAN stack. It is the front-end of the MEAN stack. Angular is widely used to develop single-page applications. To prepare to learn about Angular, one should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. TypeScript is helpful to know, but it is not required. 

## Setting up the environment for Angular 

This blog is a documentation of how Team Rocket set up the environment for Angular development using the Angular CLI tool. 

### To Install Angular

**First, click here to download** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)!

| Requirements        	| Details                                                                                                                        	|
|---------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Node.js             	| Angular requires Node.js installed. It requires an active  or maintenance LTS. Run `node -v` to check the version of  Node.js.    	|
| npm package manager 	| Angular, Angular CLI, and Angular applications is dependent on npm packages. To check if npm client is installed, run  `npm -v`. 	|

### Installing Angular CLI

The Angular CLI (Command-line Interface) is used to create projects, generate application code, and perform development tasks.

The command to install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run:
> # npm install -g @angular/cli

or use with sudo for permission error

To confirm you have installed, use the command: `ng --version`

### Creating a workspace and application

A text editor is necessary to write and run the code. Visual Studio Code is a popular IDE.<br>

To create a new workspace, use the command:
> # ng new my-app

The `ng new` command will prompt for information about features for the inital app. Accept default by pressing Enter or Return key.

### Running the application 

The Angular CLI has a server to build and serve locally

1. You navigate to the workspace folder: `cd my-app`
2. Then you run this command to launch the server: <br> `ng serve --open` <br>

    The `--open` automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.  
3. If another application is running on the default address, you can run this command to use a different port: <br>`ng serve --port`<br>

If installation and setup was successful, you should see a page like this:

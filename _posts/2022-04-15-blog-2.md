## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database for storing large amounts of data. MongoDB uses collections and documents instead of tables and rows, as in traditional relational databases. Documents are made up of key-value pairs, which are MongoDB's basic data unit. Collections are the equivalent of relational database tables in that they include sets of documents and functions. Because MongoDB is a distributed database at its heart, it comes with built-in high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution. The best part is that it is completely free to use.

## Applying MongoDB 

This blog is a documentation of how Team Rocket was able to connect Angular to our MongoDB. 

### Installing Express Mongoose and body parser.

After succesfully installing Angular, the next step would be to install Express, Mongoose and body parser. 

| Requirements        	| Command                           | Why?                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------	|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Express            	| `npm install express --save` 	    | Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own.                                                                                  |
| Mongoose            	| `npm install mongoose --save` 	| Mongoose is a program that allows us to link a NodeJS app to a MongoDB database.                                                                                              |
| body parser           | `npm install body-parser --save` 	| Body-Parser is a body-parsing middleware that allows us to parse incoming request bodies before your handlers, which are accessible via the `req.body` parameter, take effect.|

### Creating a new file server.js

Open the server.js file in the text editor.

![GitHub Actions Workflow 2](/lecure-launch-documentation.github.io/assets/images/1.PNG)

Line 1-4 helps us use the packages we had imported. In line 5-9 we instantiate the MongoDB database locally. This makes it so that if we have any errors  the DB

> # res.setHeader(‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’, "*")
connects to the websites of our choice, which is * is used to match the domain the request is from

> # res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");

## Installing Mongosh
After successfully connecting our MonogoDB to our app
Next would be to install Mongosh
 
Follow these steps in order to install [Mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/#procedure)
